# goatee.js

A templating engine...powered by goats.

You know the situation, you are putting together a web and say 'but what templating engine shall I use?' And then there are [lots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_template_engines) already.

Like for example: 

Pug,Haml.js,EJS,hbs,Squirrelly,React,h4e,hulk-hogan,combyne.js,swig,Nunjucks,marko,whiskers,Blade,Haml-Coffee,Webfiller,express-hbs,express-handlebars,express-views-dom,rivets-server,Exbars,Liquidjs,express-tl,vuexpress,Twing

But none of these are about goats.

In fact first I was going to make one called `Finland` after the great [Tom of Finland](https://tomoffinlandstore.com/) to continue the theme of facial hair, since often his men have the moustash. But not always and then [Tadas](https://twitter.com/tadas_t) came up with `goatee.js` because it is about hair and also goats.

# So here we go...

If you want to put some content in a template you can do it like this:

```
`Dear         ,
         V
 How are you doing? Thank you for visiting our webstore and buying a _----++^ ^++----_. We hope you are enjoing it.
 
 Did you know you can now get %^& &^% off your next purchase?
 
 Just quote coupon code !/--\! next time you checkout!
 
 Love
 
 The shop
 ```
 
You can imagine how it renders. The best news is, you don't need to mess around with boring old variable names. Each new dynamic in the template just uses a new Facial Hair Style (FHS)

If you run out you can grow new ones like:

```
_----++^ ^++----_
_               _
```

Or

```
_----++^ ^++----_
_               _
~               ~
```

You get the idea. As long as they are palandromic you are good.
